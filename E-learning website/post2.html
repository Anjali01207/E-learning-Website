                <p>Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be uniqueâ€”instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).<br><br>

                    Kotlin is managed by the Kotlin Foundation, a group created by JetBrains and Google, that is tasked with advancing and continuing development of the language. Kotlin is officially supported by Google for Android development, meaning that Android documentation and tooling is designed with Kotlin in mind.<br><br>

                    Certain Android APIs, like Android KTX, are Kotlin-specific, but most are written in Java and can be called from either Java or Kotlin. Kotlins interoperability with Java is core to its growth. It means that you can call into Java code from Kotlin and vice-versa, leveraging all of your existing Java libraries. Kotlins popularity results in a nicer development experience on Android, but development of the Android framework continues with both Kotlin and Java in mind.<br><br>
                    
                    Kotlin's interoperability with Java means that you dont have to adopt Kotlin all at once. You can have projects with both Kotlin and Java code. For more information on adding Kotlin to an existing app, see Add Kotlin to an existing app. If you are a part of a larger team, the size of your organization and codebase may necessitate special focus. For tips and other information, see Adopt Kotlin for large teams.<br><br>

                    Think of all the web pages you have used over the years Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.<br><br></p>
