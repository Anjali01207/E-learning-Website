              <h3>Grab a good oppurtunity by becoming data analyist</h3>
                <p>A data analyst collects, cleans, and interprets data sets to answer a question or solve a problem. They work in many industries, including business, finance, criminal justice, science, medicine, and government.

                  What kind of customers should a business target in its next ad campaign? What age group is most vulnerable to a particular disease? What patterns in behaviour are connected to financial fraud?<br><br>
                  
                  You might be pressed to answer these questions as a data analyst. Read on to learn more about what a data analyst is, what skills you'll need, and how to start on a path to becoming one.

                  Data analysis can take different forms, depending on the question you're trying to answer. Briefly, descriptive analysis tells us what happened; diagnostic analysis tells us why it happened; predictive analytics forms projections about the future; and prescriptive analysis creates actionable advice on what actions to take.<br><br>
                    
                  A data analyst is a person who gathers and interprets data to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of time spent with data but entails communicating findings too. 

                  Here's what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:
                  
                  Gather data: Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying data sets from data collection specialists.<br><br>
                  
                  Clean data: Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the data quality in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations won't be wrong or skewed. <br><br>
                  
                  Model data: This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what data types to store and collect, establish how data categories are related, and work through how the data appears.<br><br>
                  
                  Interpret data: Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that can help you answer the question at hand.<br><br>
                  
                  Present: Communicating the results of your findings will be a crucial part of your job. You create visualisations like charts and graphs, write reports, and present information to interested parties.<br><br>

Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.<br><br></p>
